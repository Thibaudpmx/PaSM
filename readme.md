# PaSM: Parameter Space Mapping algorithms for QSP applications

PaSM is a package created to accelerate the creation of plausible Virtual Patient (VP) by exploiting monotonic parameter information. 

# Manuscript

A manuscript detailing the methodology and evaluating PaSM performance [was published on JPKPD](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10928-022-09826-8). A temporary free access to the article [is also available here](https://rdcu.be/cYGNb). All the source code used in the paper (model equations, figure scripts...) are available in the [article_resources subfolder](https://github.com/Thibaudpmx/PaSM/tree/main/article_resources).

# Installation:

To install the package, please use the following code in your R session:

       devtools::install_github("Thibaudpmx/PaSM")
